Fraud Detection Analysis using Machine learning models

The main objective of the Fraud Detection Analysis is to predict that to predict Anonymized credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine.


The steps involved in the project are:

1. Exploring the dataset.

2. Handling Missing Values

3. Splitting testing and training data, Feature Scaling

4. Decision Tree Classification

5. Random Forest Classification

6. Analysis outcome.

Final result of analysis:
Decision Tree Accuracy : 99.9227549788<br> 
Random Forest Accuracy : 99.9311817084
